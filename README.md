# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A standard rock paper scissors program run entirely in HTML/CSS/JavaScript using DOM methods. Players will go through rounds against the computer by choosing their choices of play. If the player beats the computer 5 times, the player wins. If the computer beats the player 5 times, the player loses. Good Luck!

### Reflection
This project helped me combine all the core fundamental concepts I've learned of HTML/CSS/JavaScript into one webpage. I am now more familiar with working with the DOM in JavaScript, especially when interacting with Google Dev Tools and the console log for debugging. I have also become more confident in my ability to make a well-designed webpage/website.
